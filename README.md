Medical Insurance Premium Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach
üìä Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict medical insurance premiums based on individual characteristics and health attributes. Using a Random Forest Regressor algorithm, the model analyzes factors like age, BMI, medical history, and lifestyle choices to accurately estimate yearly premium costs. The project demonstrates how data science can bring transparency to insurance pricing and support data-driven decision making in healthcare.

‚ú® Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Accurate premium prediction using Random Forest algorithm (R¬≤ = 0.899)

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies age as the most significant premium determinant

Data Quality Assurance: Comprehensive data cleaning and outlier handling using Winsorization

Transparent Pricing: Provides insights into insurance pricing factors (SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities)

Healthcare Accessibility: Potential to make insurance more affordable through accurate risk assessment (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being)

Future Enhancements: Integration with insurance APIs, premium optimization suggestions, and demographic disparity analysis

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
Data & Algorithms
Dataset: Medical insurance premium records from Kaggle (986 samples, 11 features)

Primary Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning

Validation: 5-fold cross-validation with train-test split (80-20)

Feature Engineering: BMI calculation from height and weight measurements

Key Technical Processes
Data Preprocessing: Duplicate removal, missing value handling, and data type conversion

Outlier Treatment: Winsorization technique applied to handle extreme values

Exploratory Analysis: Correlation matrices, distribution plots, and binary variable analysis

Model Optimization: GridSearchCV for parameter tuning and performance enhancement

üìà Results & Impact
The implemented model achieved:

R¬≤ Score: 0.899 (89.9% of variance explained)

RMSE: 1991.18 (on a premium range of 15,000-39,000 INR)

Key Predictors: Age, transplant history, and weight identified as most significant factors
