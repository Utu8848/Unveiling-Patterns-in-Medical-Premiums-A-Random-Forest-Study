Medical Insurance Premium Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

üìä Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict medical insurance premiums based on individual characteristics and health attributes. Using a Random Forest Regressor algorithm, the model analyzes factors like age, BMI, medical history, and lifestyle choices to accurately estimate yearly premium costs. The project demonstrates how data science can bring transparency to insurance pricing and support data-driven decision making in healthcare.

‚ú® Key Features

1. Predictive Modeling: Accurate premium prediction using Random Forest algorithm (R¬≤ = 0.899)
2. Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies age as the most significant premium determinant
3. Data Quality Assurance: Comprehensive data cleaning and outlier handling using Winsorization
4. Transparent Pricing: Provides insights into insurance pricing factors (SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities)
5. Healthcare Accessibility: Potential to make insurance more affordable through accurate risk assessment (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being)
6. Future Enhancements: Integration with insurance APIs, premium optimization suggestions, and demographic disparity analysis

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
